> **Easily cancel Facebook friend requests** ‚Äî just scroll and let the script do the clicking!

üßπ A lightweight JavaScript tool that helps you cancel multiple **sent friend requests** on Facebook ‚Äî one batch at a time.

Rather than clicking each **"Cancel request"** button manually, this script automates that part. All **you need to do is scroll**, and it will handle the cancellations.

---

## üí° How It Works

This script **does not scroll automatically**.

- You scroll manually through the **Sent Requests** list.
- As new requests load in, the script:
  - Detects all visible "Cancel request" buttons
  - Clicks them one by one with a delay
- Once finished with the current batch, it checks again if more buttons are available.
- You can continue scrolling while the script works in the background.

This makes the script lightweight, safe, and non-intrusive ‚Äî ideal for long friend request lists.
